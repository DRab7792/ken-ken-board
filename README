This program was written by Dan Rabinowitz, and can be treated as an open source program.

This program can be used to create a 6x6 Kenken, or mathdoku. Three matrices are produced in this program. The first matrix is produced in create_board.py and shows the actual numbers in each square without repeating any numbers in the same row or column. The other matrices are created in create_shapes.py. The first matrix produced in the shapes script shows the outlines of the arithmetic sections. Every square that has the same number is connected and represents one arithmetic section. The second matrix produced in create_shapes.py represents the arithmetic operators that belong in each section. Designations are not assigned but the numbers 0-3 appear, which can be mapped to addition, subtraction, multiplication or division.
